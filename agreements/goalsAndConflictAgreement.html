<h1 align="center">Smorgaschord's Shared Goals <br>and Conflict-Resolution Agreement</h1>

<h2>Shared Goals</h2>
<ul> 
  <li>Camaraderie, challenge, growth, learning, fun, chocolate factory (in our dreams!).
  <li>Performance approximately once per month; on the order of a dozen performances a year.
  <li>Rehearsal weekly.   
  <li>Repertoire includes a wide variety of genres and styles.
  <li>A new song ready for performance at least every 2-3 months.
  <li>Recordings.
  <li>Mentoring from an expert coach/director as funds are available.
</ul>

<h2>Expectations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Give ample notice of scheduling conflicts for rehearsals and performances.</li>
	  
  <li>Practice at least one hour per week outside of rehearsals (to learn new songs, 
    memorize, polish, annoy your housemates, etc.) so our time together is more
	productive.</li>
	
  <li>Keep rehearsals on time; not more than 15 minutes late more than once a month, and 
    end rehearsals within 15 minutes of agreed end time. (If you are sitting in traffic
    having allowed a reasonable time, that&rsquo;s fine! Drive safe!)</li>
    
  <li>At the end of each rehearsal, make a plan to guide practice at home and in the 
    rehearsal the upcoming week&mdash;record the rehearsal as necessary to provide
	your own impromptu practice tape.</li>
  
  <li>Practice well before a performance (to be warmed up, have
    solo words on the tip of your tongue, touch difficult spots, etc.).</li>
    
  <li>Give arrangers a big piece of the final say regarding changes.</li>
  
  <li>Pay close attention to person setting tempo (watch, listen, move your body in sync; 
    do that funky thing).</li>
    
  <li>Use a metronome and/or Sibelius during early rehearsals, and again periodically, to 
    ingrain correct tempo. </li>
    
  <li>Rank and filter song list periodically (annually?): put a priority
	on recording and then dropping those that are least popular and/or
	those that induce sleep in audience members.</li>
  
  <li>Contribute in at least one way beyond weekly meetings, as time allows, e.g., arranging, 
    finding gigs, creating set lists, managing finances, taking lessons to
	improve on your own, recording gigs, pressing or printing CDs,
	selling CDs, managing web site, managing sound equipment, sound
	editing, giving feedback to other members to help them improve,
	leading the group in a session on vocal technique or rhythm, hosting
	a delicious brunch and lecture on the benefits of vacation
	timeshares in Las Vegas, etc. </li>
	
  <li>Treat each other with kindness and respect. If you feel you haven't been treated in 
    such a way, say so. Rise above the moment to model a positive, constructive
	response. Say something funny. Follow the conflict
	resolution plan below to resolve difficult problems.</li>
	
  <li>Remain open and receptive to new ideas in choreography, recording, musical styles, 
    performing naked (is that too open? Yeah, okay), etc.</li>
	
  <li>Give at least one-month notice if leaving group, if possible. If you are leaving 
    because of dissatisfaction, please let us know before the problem festers. No
	Uncle Festers! </li>
	
  <li>Review progress on above periodically.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conflict Resolution Steps </h2>

<p>In the event of a conflict, the following steps are to be taken, in
  order, until the conflict is resolved. Any member can identify a
  conflict at any time. When the person who raised awareness of the
  conflict thinks that it has been resolved, they will poll the group
  (in person or by phone, or via email if things seem pretty settled)
  to make sure. The conflict is resolved when all members of the group
  agree that it is resolved.</p>

<p><b>Step 1</b>. Identify that a conflict exists. The conflict could be at any 
  level (e.g., personal communication style, level of commitment or effort, control over an
  arrangement, tempo, tuning, etc.) between two or more members of the
  group. Any member can throw a "flag" out if they feel
  uncomfortable about a situation.  Consider neutral wording like, "I
  hear a tuning problem."</p>

<p><b>Step 2</b>. Discuss the issue (in person or by phone), clarifying
  individual perceptions. In the discussion, strive to listen
  carefully, recognize the other's needs and values. Avoid &ldquo;always&rdquo;
  or &ldquo;never&rdquo; statements, reword &ldquo;You do X&rdquo;
  statements as &ldquo;I feel X&rdquo; statements, empathize (ask why
  others feel the way they do), and think "we" rather than "I versus you." </p>

<p><b>Step 3</b>. Discuss the issue (in person or by phone) at
  least 8 hours later than previous discussion.<p>

<p><b>Step 4</b>. At least 8 hours after Step 3, write brief arguments 
  supporting each side, along with
  any suggested solutions; email to the list before the next rehearsal.</p>

<p><b>Step 5</b>. Get feedback (not official vote) from all members during group 
  discussion, moderated by mutually-agreed moderator, or ro-sham-bo-selected member.<p>

<p><b>Step 6</b>. Suspend rehearsals for 2 weeks, and discuss again as group 
  in the following rehearsal, including the option of removing one or more members. 
  Members realize that this is the last step before potentially disbanding, or voting
  to remove a member.</p>

<p><b>Step 7</b>. Members vote on removal of one or more members. If there is a tie, wait 
  2 weeks w/o rehearsal.  If tie persists, disband Smorgaschord. (Problem solved: cut the baby in two!)</p>

<br>
<p>We agree to work together in Smorgaschord with these understandings.  If
  we change our minds, we'll amend this agreement in writing.</p>
