<h1 align="center">Property Agreement of Smorgaschord</h1>
<p>Smorgaschord is a musical performance group consisting of six members: 
  Bill Anderson, Larry Hamel, Patti Schank, Mia Whitfield, Harold 
  Zable and ______________. </p>
  
<p>The members of Smorgaschord agree that the finances of Smorgaschord shall be 
  governed by the terms of this agreement, which has as its guiding principles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>fairness</li>
  <li>clarity on what to do when people enter or depart the group</li>
  <li>acknowledgement  that equipment  loses value over time and may break</li>
  <li>acknowledgement that &quot;experiential&quot; expenses (e.g., occasional guest coaching by a pro like Deke Sharon) cannot be rolled back</li>
  <li>simplicity in accounting</li>
</ul>

<p>1) Proceeds from any revenue-generating activity (e.g., gigs, CD sales) by Smorgaschord
   shall be deposited into the Smorgaschord general fund to be used for purposes as directed by majority 
   agreement of the members of Smorgaschord. These purposes typically include purchase of equipment, batteries,
   group coaching lessons, etc. Receipts shall be recorded in an online ledger, viewable by all.</p>
<p>2) Expenses from any Smorgaschord activity (e.g., coaching, equipment) shall be deducted from the general fund. 
  Any financial responsibility above the amount in the fund shall be divided equally among members 
  provided that such expenses (that exceed the current savings in the fund) are approved in advance 
  by all members. Expenses shall be recorded in an online ledger, viewable by all.</p>
<p>3) Real property (e.g., mixer, speakers) acquired by Smorgaschord shall be owned 
  in a shared fashion by each member in a percentage equal to that member's percentage 
  contribution to the purchase of the property. For example, if five members contributed $50 toward a 
  speaker that cost $250, they would each own 20% of it. Smorgaschord property is controlled by a majority vote.</p>

<h2>Arrivals</h2>
<p>4) New members start with 0% ownership of shared property, and begin to have shared ownership as the gigs 
  that they participate in generate income ("proceeds") in the general fund which are used to purchase equipment.</p>

<h2>Departures</h2>
<p>5) A person leaving Smorgaschord shall receive from Smorgaschord a cash payment, paid within a period of two months after 
   leaving Smorgaschord, an amount equal any direct financial contributions they have made (exclusive of earnings from gigs)
   as amended by the following depreciation schedule. The depreciation is based on the difference between the date of the 
   purchase of the property and the date of the departure by the person: </p>
<ul>
  <li>departure within 1 year of purchase of property: leaving person gets 75% of their original contributions.
     For example, say everyone in the group contributes $100 to buy new speakers. A person departing within 1 year
     of that contribution would receive $75 back.</li>
  <li>departure within two years of purchase of property: 50% of contributions</li>
  <li>departure within three years of purchase of property: 25% of contributions</li>
  <li>departure after three or more years: 0% (i.e., after three years, there is 
    no  payment)</li>
</ul>

<p>After receiving this cash amount, the departing person shall no longer share 
  an interest in the real property of Smorgaschord. The cash payment is an expense 
  of Smorgaschord, as described in (2), be it paid  sufficiently from the general fund or as an expense that exceeds 
  the amount in the general fund, and is hereby unanimously approved as 
  a condition of membership in Smorgaschord.
<p>5) If at any time the membership of Smorgaschord falls below three members, the 
  group is considered disbanded with regard to property ownership. Within a period 
  of two months after falling below three  members, any real property shall be liquidated--sold 
  at public auction (like Ebay.com) or purchased by members at prices determined 
  by public auction of equivalent real property (e.g., average previous auction prices on Ebay.com). Revenue from the liquidation 
  shall be returned to former members in a percentage equal to their ownership 
  as described in (3) above, less any departure payment they might have received as specified in (4) above, 
  so that former members are reimbursed (in part) for their contributions to the group. </p>
