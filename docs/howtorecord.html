<h2>How To Record</h2>

<p>How to record your part for Smorgaschord, and for the greater glory of Art and Humanity.</p>

<p>The recording kit contains seven and a half things: </p>

<ul>
	<li>microphone</li>
	<li>headset (plus adapter)</li>
	<li>MiniDisc recorder</li>
	<li>manual book for the recorder</li>
	<li>AC charger for the recorder</li>
	<li>these instructions</li>
	<li> CD with sing-along track(s)</li>
</ul>

<p>The half item is for the microphone plug, which has both 
	a 1/8 inch plug and an adapter for a 1/4 inch plug (see long, 
	boring description below).</p>

<p>Your mission: listen to a recorded version of Sibelius (or 
	perhaps in the future a _provided_ recording of Smorgaschord) 
	in the headphones while you sing your part into the microphone/recorder. 
	You will need a quiet room to do this, and a CD player. You 
	can also use Sibelius with headphones if you like, instead 
	of the CD player.</p>

<p>Executive summary of the steps to record:</p>
  <ol>
	<li> Put CD into stereo</li>
	<li>Plug headphones into stereo</li>
	<li>Start recording (REC button first, then &quot;play/go&quot; button)</li>
	<li>Turn on microphone switch</li>
	<li>Play the song (get key and tempo from 
		first bar(s) that have been added for this purpose)</li>
	<li>Sing!</li>
	<li>Stop recording with stop button (squarebutton)</li>
	<li>Turn off microphone)</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Here is the hardest thing to remember:</p>
  <p>The microphone has a switch on it. There is an AA battery 
	inside the microphone, and the switch on the microphone should 
	be off when you're not recording. It is easy to forget to 
	turn it off. The battery will wear out if you forget and leave 
	it on. (The battery is accessed by unscrewing the bottom of 
	the microphone.)</p>
  <p>Ease your mind about this:</p>
  <p>Recording always starts with a new track, so you cannot hurt 
	anybody else's recording without really trying. No worries!</p>
  <p>The microphone's &quot;on&quot; switch has two positions, 
	one for 90&deg; stereo and the other for 120&deg;. It doesn't 
	matter which of these you use. The MiniDisc recorder is set 
	to &quot;mono&quot;, so it just combines the stereo coming 
	out of the microphone. </p>
  <p>The headphones have a plug that is a fancy two-in-one plug. 
	A quarter-inch adaptor plug fits over the eighth-inch plug 
	by screwing (right to tight). So if your stereo needs a quarter-inch 
	plug, convert the microphone plug as needed. Conversely, if 
	the plug appears to be too big, and you need a smaller one, 
	(e.g., to listen to recordings on the MiniDisc), remove the 
	quarter-inch plug by unscrewing.</p>
  <p>The MiniDisc recorder has three jacks (holes) on the right 
	side. The label for each jack is on the back of the recorder. 
	One of the jacks is red--that's where the microphone goes. 
	There's another jack for &quot;line in&quot;. We don't use 
	that one. The headphones jack is labeled with a picture of 
	headphones (you were expecting chopped liver?). It is a round 
	hole in the middle of a rectangular, black-plastic jack which 
	accommodates a fancy headphones gizmo that is not included 
	in the kit. </p>
  <p>But I said that just to confuse you. You put the headphones 
	in the recorder only to listen to the recording after you've 
	recorded it. During the recording, you'll need to plug the 
	headphones into your stereo to listen to the CD (or into your 
	computer if you're using Sibelius playback).</p>
  <p>On the face of the recorder, there is the red &quot;REC&quot; 
	record button (it looks like it may just be a light, but it 
	is both a light and a button), and the usual stop, play/go, 
	back and fast-forward buttons arranged in a circle. There 
	are also plus and minus volume buttons, and other buttons 
	that don't matter for now.</p>
  <p>With the headphones in the recorder, you can listen to tracks 
	on the recorder by simply pressing the go/play button (the 
	button with the single triangle pointing to the right). That 
	will turn on the recorder and begin to play the first track, 
	if any tracks have been recorded. You can move through the 
	different tracks by pressing the fast-forward button (the 
	button with two arrows pointing to the right). Volume is controlled 
	with the volume buttons, plus and minus. Press the stop button 
	(the button with a square) to stop playing. Press it twice 
	to turn off the recorder. The recorder will automatically 
	turn itself off after a couple minutes of idling.</p>
  <p>Here is the second-hardest thing to remember:</p>
  <p>To record, you have to do two things. First, with the microphone 
	connected, you press the record button (REC), which gives 
	you a chance to set the recording level. Second, you click 
	the play/go button to actually start recording.</p>
  <p>The record button puts you into the &quot;set recording level&quot; 
	state. If you speak into the microphone (with the microphone 
	switch turned on), you should see some bars appear across 
	the top of the recorder screen. The bars measure the amplitude 
	of the sound. In other words, if you speak louder or closer 
	to the microphone, more bars should appear, and vice versa. 
	The recording level should have already been adjusted to a 
	good place, but if you like, you can adjusted again by using 
	the plus and minus buttons while in this &quot;record level&quot; 
	state. You know that you are in the recording-level state, 
	and not the actual recording state, because the numbers in 
	the bottom right corner (counting the seconds of recording) 
	are not counting up. As soon as you click the go (play) button, 
	you will start recording for real, and the counter will be 
	counting up.</p>
  <p>An ideal setting for the recording level depends on how close 
	you hold the microphone. Hold the microphone at a comfortable 
	distance for you, and sing really loudly. The bars may go 
	all the way to the second, tiny dot at the top of the screen 
	but not go very near the rightmost tiny dot at the top of 
	the screen. Again, the recording level should be preset, and 
	you should not have to worry about this. This recording system 
	has very little noise, so recording at a low recording level 
	(16 or so on this recorder) should be fine. If you hold the 
	microphone really close and sing loudly, however, the recording 
	may clip. Use good microphone technique and everything should 
	go fine. Keep in mind that we can and will adjust volume later, 
	and this mic will pick up soft singing very nicely.</p>
  <p>OK, so if you are in the recording-level state after clicking 
	the record button, then all you need to do is click the go 
	(play) button to begin recording. The track number that will 
	be recorded is flashing in the lower left corner. Keep track 
	on a piece of paper the number of each track you record, along 
	with any notes about the track. There is a way to delete tracks 
	(see manual), but it is probably easiest to just keep recording 
	tracks until you get one you like, and tell us what number 
	it is.</p>
  <p>Keep in mind that digital recording time is cheap, so you 
	can start recording well before you are ready to sing. We 
	can just edit out that part of the track. You may want to 
	do two or three takes because it is easy to make a singing 
	mistake at first, while you're getting used to hearing the 
	Sibelius track. You do not have to be perfect because we can 
	&quot;punch in&quot; corrections, but the goal is to get a 
	pretty good take from everyone individually.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The sing-along track has an intro bar or two which simply 
	sounds quarter notes, giving you the key and tempo. Listen 
	to the opening once or twice, to get a feel for it. You listen 
	silently to the opening bar(s), and then start singing at 
	the right time.</p>
  <p>To listen to your take, switch the headphones from the stereo 
	to the headphones jack of the recorder, and press the go (play) 
	button. Holding down the fast-forward and back buttons will 
	fast-forward and rewind, respectively, within the song. If 
	you just press and release, the fast-forward and rewind buttons 
	will change tracks.</p>
  <p>Don't worry about we recharging the recorder battery if it 
	still has some juice. The battery lasts a long time, and should 
	be recharged when it is completely empty. The recorder is 
	small and easy to drop. Careful! I found it convenient to 
	put it in my pants pocket when I was recording, so that I 
	could concentrate on holding the microphone and singing.</p>
  <p>All of this recording mumbo jumbo is difficult at first, 
	but the alternative is spending hours and hours in an expensive 
	recording studio. Let's give it a try and see how it goes.<br>
